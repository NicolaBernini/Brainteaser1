Some Brainteasers and Questions relarding the Point Distribution Distance 

## Point PDF Distance 

Q1) What is the purpose of estimating the probability of a certain point belonging to a certain PDF ? 

Hint: Define a distance measeure 

What is a very typical application of this approach ? 

<br/>

Q2) What is the purpose of estimating the probability of a certain point belonging to a certain Set of Sample Points ? 

What does it change with respect to the previous case ? 

<br/>

Q3) What kind of distance measeure can be defined to perform this estimation, under the assumption of "spherical distribution" ? 

Why is this assumption important ? 

<br/>

Q4) Provide an example of a case where this assumption does not hold ? 

What the new distance measure should consider in this case ? 

Hint: One information more (i.e. something that assuming spherical distribution was not important)

<br/>

Q5) Why is Mahalanobis distance important ? 

What is its use case ? 

Does this distance reduce to simpler one in certain cases ?
